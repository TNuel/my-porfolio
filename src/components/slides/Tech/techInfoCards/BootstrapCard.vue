    <h1>Bootstrap - CSS framework</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    I was sceptic about the Bootstrap at first but now I cannot imagine life without it. It basically replace CSS for me before Tailwind ðŸ˜‚. If used incorrectly
    syntax can become bloated but if used correctly... Oh&nbsp;boy...

  <p>
    It is a highly customizable, in-built CSS framework that gives you all of the already styled components you need to build bespoke designs without
    any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
    It simple and fast.
